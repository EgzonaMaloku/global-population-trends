### Accuracy

The evaluation of the dataset revealed several accuracy concerns:

- **Missing Countries:** The dataset does not include certain countries, such as Kosovo and Serbia, and fails to adequately represent some islands that are part of other countries.
  
- **Comparison with World Bank Data:** A comparison was performed between our dataset and the World Bank dataset for 10 selected countries over 8 years (from 1960 to 2020, increasing by 10 years). The results of this comparison showed:
  - **Total Population:** Our dataset differs by **2.08%** from the World Bank figures.
  - **Urban Population:** The difference is **2.36%** compared to World Bank data.

While the dataset provides a close approximation of population statistics, the missing countries and percentage differences highlight areas for improvement in accuracy. Further validation from authoritative sources is recommended to enhance the dataset's reliability.
