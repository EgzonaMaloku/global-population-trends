# Global Population and Forecast Analysis

This project combines historical and forecasted population data for different countries, to analyze trends like population growth, urbanization, demographic changes, and migration.

## Key Features

### Historical vs. Forecasted Data:
Each row is labeled as either "Historical" or "Forecasted" to help compare past data with future predictions.

### Types of Analysis:

- **Population Growth**: Compare how population growth (percentage change and absolute numbers) evolved in the past vs. predictions for the future.
- **Urbanization**: Analyze how urban populations have grown historically and what is projected for the future.
- **Demographic Shifts**: Examine changes in median age, fertility rates, and other factors over time.
- **Migration**: Investigate historical and forecasted migration patterns to see changes in immigration and emigration.

## Visualizing Trends:
Use charts (e.g., line charts, bar charts) to visualize trends from 1950 to 2040, comparing past data with future projections.

### Example Analysis Questions:

- **Are global population growth rates expected to decline in the future compared to historical rates?**
- **How does the future forecast for urbanization compare to historical trends?**
- **Which countries will see the largest changes in population size and structure over the next few decades?**
- **What regions are expected to experience the largest migration inflows or outflows?**

## How to Use

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- pandas library (`pip install pandas`)
